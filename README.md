## Database

For simplicity reasons we use sqlite as our main database. SQLite is already integrated in to python and doesn't need aditional services.
In the folder sqliteTutorial you can find a short example for the main usecases (CREATE, WRITE, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)

## Binance API

As a first excercise/try we will use the Binance REST API.
